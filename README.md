🤖 AI & Machine Learning Portfolio – Kushal J R

Welcome to my AI & Machine Learning engineering portfolio!
This repository showcases my academic, internship, and hands-on projects focused on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and RAG-based AI systems, built using Python and modern ML frameworks.

👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Kushal J R, a B.Tech Computer Science (AI & ML) student at Dayananda Sagar University with a strong interest in software development and applied AI.
I enjoy building end-to-end AI applications — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Flask and real-time dashboards.

Through projects and my AI Internship at Troogue AI, I have worked on computer vision systems, RAG-based AI assistants, and ML pipelines, focusing on accuracy, usability, and clean implementation.

🛡️ Online Exam Cheating Detection Using Video Analysis

Tech Stack: Python, Flask, OpenCV, ML

A real-time AI system to detect cheating behavior during online exams using video analysis.

🔹 Key Features:

Extracts video frames from live or recorded exam footage
Annotation dashboard for labeling frames
Frame-level classification: Cheating / Not Cheating
CSV dataset generation for ML training
Real-time monitoring dashboard
prediction = model.predict(frame_features)
if prediction == 1:
    print("Cheating Detected")
else:
    print("Normal Behavior")
